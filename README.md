# SpaceOdyssey

SpaceOdyssey is a Java-based game originally created as a console application by Alberto Leon, Chris Covey, and Jojo George Mattam. Our team has updated the project to maintain its core functionality while adding a Swing-based graphical user interface (GUI). The result is the same engaging game experience, now with a visual interface that allows users to interact using the mouse.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface**: Enhanced with a Swing-based UI for a more interactive experience.
- **Original Game Mechanics**: Core gameplay elements retained from the original console version.
- **Mouse Interaction**: Users can interact with the game through a visual interface.

## Usage

1. **Launch the Application**:
   - Download the .zip file that is inside the `_compiled` folder (`star-odyssey-rpg.zip`).
   - Unzip the downloaded file.
   - You should end up with a folder named `star-odyssey-rpg` which content will be `star-odyssey-rpg.jar` and a folder `data`.
   - Double click `star-odyssey-rpg.jar` and the application will open.

2. **Gameplay**:
   - **Controls**: Use the mouse to interact with the game elements.
   - **Objective**: Follow the game's instructions and goals as presented in the visual interface.
